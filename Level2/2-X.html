        Some Questions about the Storm
        BY HILDA RAZ

        <div class="Amazing"> <!--style="border: 1px solid red"-->
            <p>
            What's the bird ratio overhead?
            Zero: zero. Maybe it's El Ni√±o?

            The storm, was it bad?
            Here the worst ever. Every tree hurt.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="Valkyrie">
            <p>
            Do you love trees?
            Only the <span class="NotAmazing"> <!--<span class="NotAmazing" style="text-transform: uppercase;">-->
            gingko, the fir, the birch.</span>
                    <!--<span class="highlight">-->        
            Yours? Do you name your trees?
            Who owns the trees? Who's talking

            You presume a dialogue. Me and You.
            Yes. Your fingers tap. I'm listening.

            Will you answer? Why mention trees?
            When the weather turned rain into ice, the leaves failed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
        So what? Every year leaves fail. The cycle. Birth to death.
        In the night the sound of cannon, and death everywhere.

        What did you see?
        Next morning, roots against the glass.

        Who's talking now and in familiar language? Get real.
        What's real is the broken crown. The trunk shattered.

        Was that storm worse than others?
        Yes and no. The wind's torque twisted open the tree's tibia.

        Fool. You're talking about vegetables. Do you love the patio
            tomato? The Christmas cactus?
        Yes. And the magnolia on the roof, the felled crabapple, the topless
            spruce.
