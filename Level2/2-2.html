        Some Questions about the Storm
        <br>

        <br>
        <strong>What's the bird ratio overhead?
        <br>Zero: zero. Maybe it's El Ni√±o?</strong>

        <br>

        <br>
        <em>The storm, was it bad?
        <br>Here the worst ever. Every tree hurt.</em>

        <br>

        <br>
        <big>Do you love trees?
        <br>Only the gingko, the fir, the birch.</big>

        <br>

        <br>
        <small>Yours? Do you name your trees?
        <br>Who owns the trees? Who's talking</small>

        <br>

        <h5>
            <br>You presume a dialogue. Me and You.
            <br>Yes. Your fingers tap. I'm listening.
        </h5>

        <br>

        <h6>
            <br>Will you answer? Why mention trees?
            <br>When the weather turned rain into ice, the leaves failed.
        </h6>
        
        <br>

        <h5>
            <br>So what? Every year leaves fail. The cycle. Birth to death.
            <br>In the night the sound of cannon, and death everywhere.
        </h5>
        
        <br>

        <br>
        <small>What did you see?
        <br>Next morning, roots against the glass.</small>

        <br>

        <br>
        <big>Who's talking now and in familiar language? Get real.
        <br>What's real is the broken crown. The trunk shattered.</big>

        <br>

        <br>
        <em>Was that storm worse than others?
        <br>Yes and no. The wind's torque twisted open the tree's tibia.</em>

        <br>

        <br><strong>Fool. You're talking about vegetables. Do you love the patio
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tomato? The Christmas cactus?
        <br>Yes. And the magnolia on the roof, the felled crabapple, the topless
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spruce.</strong>
