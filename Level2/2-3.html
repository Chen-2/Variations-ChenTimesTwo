        Some Questions about the Storm
        <br>

        <ol>

            <ul>
                <br>What's the bird ratio overhead?
                <br>Zero: zero. Maybe it's El Niño?

                <li>
                    The storm, was it bad?
                    <br>Here the worst ever. Every tree hurt.
                </li>
                    
                <li>
                    Do you love trees?
                    <br>Only the gingko, the fir, the birch.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Yours? Do you name your trees?
                    <br>Who owns the trees? Who's talking
                </li>

                <br>You presume a dialogue. Me and You.
                <br>Yes. Your fingers tap. I'm listening.
                
                <li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Will you answer? Why mention trees?
                            <br>When the weather turned rain into ice, the leaves failed.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            So what? Every year leaves fail. The cycle. Birth to death.
                            <br>In the night the sound of cannon, and death everywhere.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>
                            What did you see?
                            <br>Next morning, roots against the glass.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Who's talking now and in familiar language? Get real.
                            <br>What's real is the broken crown. The trunk shattered.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>
                            Was that storm worse than others?
                            <br>Yes and no. The wind's torque twisted open the tree's tibia.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Fool. You're talking about vegetables. Do you love the patio
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tomato? The Christmas cactus?
                            <br>Yes. And the magnolia on the roof, the felled crabapple, the topless
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spruce.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
