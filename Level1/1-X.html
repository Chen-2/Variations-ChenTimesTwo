        Some Questions about the Storm
        BY HILDA RAZ
        </p>
        
        <br>
        What's the bird ratio overhead?
        <br>Zero: zero. Maybe it's El Ni√±o?

        <br>The storm, was it bad?
        <br>Here the worst ever. Every tree hurt.

        <br>Do you love trees?
        <br>Only the gingko, the fir, the birch.

        <br>Yours? Do you name your trees?
        <br>Who owns the trees? Who's talking

        <br>You presume a dialogue. Me and You.
        <br>Yes. Your fingers tap. I'm listening.

        <br>Will you answer? Why mention trees?
        <br>When the weather turned rain into ice, the leaves failed.

        <br>So what? Every year leaves fail. The cycle. Birth to death.
        <br>In the night the sound of cannon, and death everywhere.

        <br>What did you see?
        <br>Next morning, roots against the glass.

        <br>Who's talking now and in familiar language? Get real.
        <br>What's real is the broken crown. The trunk shattered.

        <br>Was that storm worse than others?
        <br>Yes and no. The wind's torque twisted open the tree's tibia.

        <br>Fool. You're talking about vegetables. Do you love the patio
            <p class="Alpha">tomato? The Christmas cactus?</p>
        <br>Yes. And the magnolia on the roof, the felled crabapple, the topless
            <p class="Beta">spruce.</p>
