        Some Questions about the Storm
        <br>

        <br>
        What's the bird ratio overhead?
        Zero: zero. Maybe it's El Ni√±o?

        <br>The storm, was it bad?
        Here the worst ever. Every tree hurt.

        <br>Do you love trees?
        Only the gingko, the fir, the birch.

        <br>Yours? Do you name your trees?
        Who owns the trees? Who's talking

        <br>You presume a dialogue. Me and You.
        Yes. Your fingers tap. I'm listening.

        <br>Will you answer? Why mention trees?
        When the weather turned rain into ice, the leaves failed.

        <br>So what? Every year leaves fail. The cycle. Birth to death.
        In the night the sound of cannon, and death everywhere.

        <br>What did you see?
        Next morning, roots against the glass.

        <br>Who's talking now and in familiar language? Get real.
        What's real is the broken crown. The trunk shattered.

        <br>Was that storm worse than others?
        Yes and no. The wind's torque twisted open the tree's tibia.

        <br>Fool. You're talking about vegetables. Do you love the patio
                tomato? The Christmas cactus?
            Yes. And the magnolia on the roof, the felled crabapple, the topless
                spruce.
