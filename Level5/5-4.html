        Some Questions about the Storm
        <br>
        BY HILDA RAZ

        <h1 class="alpha">
            What's the bird ratio overhead?
            <br>Zero: zero. Maybe it's El Ni√±o?
        </h1>

        <h2 class="beta">
            The storm, was it bad?
            <br>Here the worst ever. Every tree hurt.
        </h2>

        <h3 class="gamma">
            Do you love trees?
            <br>Only the gingko, the fir, the birch.
        </h3>    
   
        <h4 class="omega">
            Yours? Do you name your trees?
            <br>Who owns the trees? Who's talking
        </h4>
        
        <h5 class="theta">
            You presume a dialogue. Me and You.
            <br>Yes. Your fingers tap. I'm listening.
        </h5>

        <h6 class="delta">
            Will you answer? Why mention trees?
            <br>When the weather turned rain into ice, the leaves failed.
        </h6>

        <h5 class="pi">
            So what? Every year leaves fail. The cycle. Birth to death.
            <br>In the night the sound of cannon, and death everywhere.
        </h5>

        <h4 class="mu">
            What did you see?
            <br>Next morning, roots against the glass.
        </h4>

        <h3 class="sigma">
            Who's talking now and in familiar language? Get real.
            <br>What's real is the broken crown. The trunk shattered.
        </h3>

        <h2 class="lambda">
            Was that storm worse than others?
            <br>Yes and no. The wind's torque twisted open the tree's tibia.
        </h2>

        <h1 class="rho">
            Fool. You're talking about vegetables. Do you love the patio
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tomato? The Christmas cactus?
            Yes. And the magnolia on the roof, the felled crabapple, the topless
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spruce.
